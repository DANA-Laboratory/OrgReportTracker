# Report Tracker
Small app to track reporting process of a set of *Performance Indicators* for organizations 

## What is everything about:
  A set of seasonal measured PIs will palce in a formated report that mirrors conditions of organization in different aspects.

## How it could help:
  This app could help managers getting, collecting, saveing, analysing, exporting, trending, reporting or searching through PIs.

## Motivations for us:
  This project is a open source app with different incentives which involves: 
  - Creation of training contants for a workshop about web apps. 
  - Also we want to develop a practical simple application to help create seasonal reports of a set of performance indicators.
  - Also we want to introduce capabilities and encourage use of open-source codes that are freely avaliable.  
  
## Understanding Performance Indicators:
  PIs are directly *measured* or *calculated* values that are important indicators of performance for managers of organizations. They are measured periodically in predefined *units* by authorized personals that we will call them *providers*. Providers are employees of different sub departments of organization that are responsible for providing a set of related PIs by measuring them before a dead time. Also PIs could have *target* values, targets are set by PI *ownners* for oncomming measuring priods, (that are mostly seasonal) before a financial year begins.
  
## Report
  The values of set of periodically measured PIs will be arrange to create a printable view.
  
## Users:
 Beside *providers*, *ownners* of PIs, *report* could have *reviewer*, *owner* and *reader*.

## Use cases
  The process involves, adding attachment and commenting on PIs
