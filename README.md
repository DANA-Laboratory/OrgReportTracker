# Performance Indicator Reporting and Managing Application
Small app to track reporting process of a set of *Performance Indicators* for organizations

## Understanding Performance Indicators
  PIs are directly *measured* or *calculated* values that are important indicators of performance for managers of organizations. They are measured periodically in predefined *units* by authorized personals that we will call them *providers*. Providers are employees of different sub departments of organization that are responsible for providing a set of related PIs by measuring them before a dead time. Also PIs could have *target* values, targets are set by PI *ownners* for oncomming measuring priods, (that are mostly seasonal) before a financial year begins.

## What does everything about
  A set of seasonal or monthly measured PIs will palce in a formated report that mirrors conditions of organization in different aspects.

## How it could help
  This app could help managers getting, collecting, saveing, analysing, exporting, trending, reporting or searching through PIs.

## Motivations for us
  This project is a open source app with different incentives which involves:
  - Creation of training contants for a workshop about web apps.
  - Also we want to develop a practical simple application to help create seasonal reports of a set of performance indicators.
  - Also we want to introduce capabilities and encourage use of open-source codes that are freely avaliable.  

## Report
  Values of a set of periodically measured PIs for the time of reporting will be arrange to create a printable view that called *report*. reports have *attachemnts* and a *time limit* which after that time its state will be read only.

## Users
 Beside *provider* and *ownner* of PI, *report* could have *reviewer*, *owner* and *reader*.

## Some special use-cases
  The process involves, adding attachment to report and commenting on PIs.
