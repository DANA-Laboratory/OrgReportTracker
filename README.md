## Understanding Performance Indicators:
  PIs are directly *measured* or *calculated* values that are important indicators of performance for managers of organizations. They are measured periodically in predefined *units* by authorized personals that we will call them *providers*. Providers are employees of different sub departments of organization that are responsible for providing a set of related PIs by measuring them before a dead time. Also PIs could have *target* values, targets are set by PI *ownners* before a financial year starts, for oncomming measuring priods, that are normally seasonal.
